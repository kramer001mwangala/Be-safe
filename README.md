This is the ussd part and the dashboard
We used nodejs for backend and also used React for the admin dasboard
To access the backend since its running on local host we use the following steps
firts git clone the project 
then run npm start to build the dependancies 
cd backend 
and then run nodemon index.js
Also rember to start your xamp file
After this start ngrok to ensure your port is up and running
copy the url for ngrok and add to your code
This willl make you be able to acess the ussd through AT sandbox


For the admin dashborad cd secre frontend  and run npm start the development server will be shown
